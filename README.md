Display Development on Employee Attrition and Sales Data
----------------

This project involves the use of Watson Analytics to analyze two datasets: an employee attrition dataset and a sales profits and costs dataset.  My goal is to analyze these datasets using visualizations and see how the results can help my company.  I will then communicate my findings using displays and storybooks.  Additionally, I will incorporate social media data from Twitter that is relevant to my two datasets.  I will explore and present this data in visual format to provide useful insights for my organization.

The two datasets used in this project are identical to those used in my EDA and decision tree projects using Watson Analytics.  Thus, I recommend viewing those projects to understand the visualizations I am using in this project.  Links to these two projects are provided below:

The full report can be found in the file "Display Development.pdf".  This report shows a complete breakdown of my analysis, including problem identification, motivation, data exploration, dashboard development, results, social media analysis, storybook development, and applications.  Tables and visualizations are included in the appendix.

The datasets are located in the files "employee attrition.xlsx" and "Retail-SalesMarketing_-ProfitCost_cleaned.xlsx".  They have been cleaned of outliers, missing values, and errors.  The original files were obtained from IBM's list of sample datasets:

The social media data can only be obtained directly from Watson Analytics.  It was created by importing Twitter data and using hashtags based on the top product types from my sales dataset (including products such as eyewear, packs, and sleeping bags).
